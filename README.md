# Icons for the Axon Ivy Eclipse based Designer

In this repository we store icons for the Axon Ivy Eclipse based Designer, which
are deployed to a Maven artifactory and re-integrated over `thirdparty-libs`.

## Deprecation

Axon Ivy 14 is no longer shipped with an Eclipse based Designer, therefore
these icons are no longer needed.
